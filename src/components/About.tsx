                    software. On my voyage through computer science I want to not only elevate my skills and knowlege but help
                others learn and build cool things as well. Videogames have been one of the most influential things in my life,
                inspiring me to learn all about computers since I was kid. I first started coding in my junior year of highschool 
                and eventually went to college at CU Denver for Computer Science. After lots of failier, dropping out, and joining
                the Full Stack Bootcamp at Denver University, I was able to refine the way I approach difficult problems and fell
                in love with coding again!</p>
